# 🎯Irritainment --> A Sarcastic Cure for Your Screen Addiction

## *Because clearly you need an app to tell you got a life 😏*

This project is a React + TypeScript web app that uses TensorFlow.js BlazeFace to detect whether you’re looking at your screen. The twist?

* Sometimes it lets you watch videos.

* Sometimes it forces you to look away.

* And it does this on a timer — because we're controlling your screen time like a hawk.

## 🚀 Features
* **Free Play Mode 🎬**\
Enjoy your video for a short duration (default: 20s). A countdown timer shows you how long you’re free before Big Brother kicks in.

* **Face Detection Mode 🕵️**\
BlazeFace detects your face — if you look at the screen, the video pauses. If you look away, it plays. This continues for a fixed duration (default: 60s).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

* Face Detection: TensorFlow.js BlazeFace

* Video Control: HTML5 video API

## ⚙️ How It Works
* Free Play Mode (20 seconds)

* Countdown timer shows remaining free time

* Face Detection Mode (60 seconds)

* Video pauses if you're looking at the screen

* Video resumes if you look away

* Repeat Forever

* Cycles between free play and face detection until you quit (or rage quit 😂)

## 🤡 Disclaimer
This app is purely for fun (and sarcasm). If you actually want to control your screen addiction... maybe just, you know, go outside. 🌳


## Contribution
Presently the app only has frontend part done. I will highly appreciate if someone contributes to the backend and makes it a full fledged app.
